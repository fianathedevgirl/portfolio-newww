One upon a time, lived a lonely princess named Clara living lonely. Her subjects were but all of them, for the Witch Lady had taken the whole population captive years ago. 

Her aids were used to be of fine selection of the commons, but only her old penpal, Jasmine, remains.

"Jasmine, how can we address these crises, for the commons have long suffered?‚Äù

"Clara, I knew a mage dwelling in the magical forest."

To be continued..

This is still WIP!!!
