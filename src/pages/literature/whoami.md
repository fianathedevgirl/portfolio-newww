On a dark corner..</br>
Tears raining, dark and cloudy, the sky was..

"I.. wish I was not like this," said a little youngling.</br>
One's gazed the sea of clouds, wondering about one's dark life.

"For I don't belong with my friends"</br>

"I wish I could be like them"</br>
"Cheerful friends"</br>
"Jokes and funs!"</br>
"We could spent our school days together"</br>
"And yet, here we are.."
