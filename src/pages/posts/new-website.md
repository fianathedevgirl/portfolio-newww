Hiiii!!! It has been quite sometime since I last made a blog.

Todayy, I'm happy to release this new website that I made. It'll be more integrated. The blog will be here. 

# Leaving Substack
For making programming blogs, it doesn't seem really good, since Substack doesn't have syntax highlighting.

Embedding my blog to my own site also allows me to embed much more interactive content!

# Vite

I always wanted to try Vite, but haven't been able to! Fortunately, we have this website project.

Initially I wanted to use Vite Plugin SSR, but it wasn't really nice, the markdown experience wasn't as straight forward as in Astro. I decided to switch to Astro altogether ^^

# It's the first time for me trying out Astro

Astro is not a React-based framework or anything, it's its own thing! The only limitation here is that, for my portfolio I highly use React Spring. But thankfully Astro allows using components from other UI frameworks inside of it! 
They also have the concept of islands, which makes them pretty much isolated from the others!


# A new fresh start!!
Another alternative to Astro is [Fresh](https://github.com/denoland/fresh), it's pretty much Astro but made for the Deno Node.js runtime! It is also made by the Deno developers themselves!!! It's actively developed, but it's just released like, still not a long ago!!
